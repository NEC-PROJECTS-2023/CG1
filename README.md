Introduction

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a highly popular Twenty20 cricket league held annually in
India. One of the most exciting aspects of the IPL is predicting which team will emerge as the
winner in any given match. In recent years, the use of statistical models to predict the win
probability of teams has become increasingly popular. This project aims to develop an IPL win
probability prediction model using machine learning algorithms. Algorithms such as Logistic
Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine are used in our project. The model
will be trained on historical IPL match data, taking into account various factors such as team
composition, player performance, and venue conditions. The ultimate goal is to create a model
that can accurately predict the win probability of any given team in an IPL match, allowing
fans and analysts to make informed predictions and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in IPL
cricket
